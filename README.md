# Tick-Tack-Toe-Game
Python Tick Tack Toe Game Using MiniMax Algorithm
<br>
This is my first official project on github

Firstly a GUI has been made using Tkinter. It is quite simple. It just has 9 buttons. On clicking the buttons, they display an 'X' or an 'O' depending on who's turn it is

Next, I have made a board to keep track of the game and prevented overwriting, two issues of the previous version. Moreover, the code has been made more streamline. A function has been added to see which player wins the game and to reset the board.
